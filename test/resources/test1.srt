00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,279
Hello and welcome to this new edition of the Schkopi Show.

2
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,228
We have exciting things in store for you today,

3
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:29,689
first an interview with harmonicist Frédéric Yonnet,

4
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,548
then a fan interview like no other with Olimpia.

5
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,763
Next, our princely experts will exchange their opinions

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,184
about Prince as a composer and producer.

7
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,050
Finally, we'll end this show with an improvised jam session

8
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:41,672
with Dom Briki and Frédéric Yonnet.

9
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:43,219
Let's go for the 3rd Schkopi Show !

10
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,065
We're fortunate to have harmonicist Frédéric Yonnet for our show.

11
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,896
Welcome and thank you, Frédéric, for accepting our invitation.

12
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:39,656
For those who don't know you, you're a world renowned artist.

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,626
You had the opportunity to play with great artists in France, Europe,

14
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,605
Africa and the United States.

15
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:47,721
That said, could you present us in a few words your career path ?

16
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,051
My career path ?

17
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:53,431
As you said I'm Frédéric Yonnet, I'm a Frenchman living in the United-States

18
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:55,431
and I play the diatonic harmonica.

19
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:59,627
I moved to the United States almost 10 years ago.

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,293
When I was still in Paris, I worked at the Canal + TV channel

21
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,206
with people like Patrick Ferbac and Lol et le Groupe.

22
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,587
I also recorded for Guesch Patti, Blue Fever and many others ...

23
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:18,397
How did you start playing the harmonica ? When did you get that passion for it ?

24
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:22,112
My passion for it came naturally.

25
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,613
It's an attractive instrument in itself.

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,081
It fits in your pocket and it isn't very expensive.

27
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:34,645
Moreover, there's a whole range of sounds that can come out of this instrument,

28
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:45,122
which is actually very little known and highly stereotyped as belonging to blues

29
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,721
or country music.

30
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:51,171
I actually realized there was a huge potential in a music genre in which

31
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,304
I identified myself more.

32
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,033
It's true that it's an instrument somewhat underestimated

33
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,685
and which isn't as easy to handle as it seems.

34
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:03,480
Most of the time the audience respects more guitarists

35
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,592
such as Carlos Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Richards and Prince of course.

36
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,887
But who were your inspirations ?

37
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,647
Who were the people who influenced you to keep playing ?

38
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:19,519
I was influenced by some of the most renowned harmonicists,

39
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,665
such as Stevie Wonder of course,

40
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:27,220
then there is in the jazz world the absolutely phenomenal Toots Thielemans

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,371
who is from Brussels.

42
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:51,350
But, these harmonicists play a different instrument,

43
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:56,003
since they play the chromatic harmonica.

44
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,714
And I finally realized in the world of the diatonic harmonica,

45
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:06,378
there were very few people who had incorporated the instrument

46
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,682
into a bit more elaborated music than blues or country.

47
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:12,170
For example, in jazz and fusion music,

48
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:15,486
there are almost only Howard Levy or maybe French harmonicist

49
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,188
Sébastien Charlier.

50
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:23,803
They really work to integrate the harmonica into a bit more elaborated music.

51
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,173
So I thought there was an opportunity for me.

52
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,060
What you just said enables me to talk about what I read on your website.

53
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,821
I quote: "Frédéric Yonnet's ability to play chromatic scales

54
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,116
on the diatonic harmonica surprises people !

55
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,202
It enables him to have a wide range of sounds,

56
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,756
of which he can use every possibility.

57
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:43,134
Everyone is amazed by his technical mastery of the 12 keys.

58
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,735
Lovers of 2 harmonicas, chromatic and diatonic, applaud him !"

59
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,610
So, for people like me who aren't at all musicians,

60
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,915
could you explain to us what's the difference between a chromatic harmonica

61
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,209
and a diatonic one ?

62
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:56,592
I'm gonna make it easy for everybody to understand.

63
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,696
It's great there's a microphone on the table because we can take advantage of it.

64
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:08,282
The diatonic harmonica is an instrument which only has 19 notes over 3 octaves.

65
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:14,003
So, a harmonica in C has the C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C notes.

66
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,202
Although, not all the harmonica notes are here,

67
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:18,664
in some sides of the harmonica they have to be created artificially.

68
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:22,395
So, actually, a harmonica in C gives you these sounds -

69
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:35,572
That's what you get from a harmonica in C.

70
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:37,783
These are all the notes on this harmonica,

71
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:40,095
although half of them are really artificial, but let's move on.

72
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,216
On a chromatic harmonica, in fact, there are 2 harmonicas

73
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:46,690
combined on the same instrument.

74
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,951
That is to say, there are one instrument in C and an instrument tuned

75
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:53,086
a semitone above in C-sharp.

76
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,397
As a result, it enables to access to all the black and white keys

77
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,054
on the piano keyboard.

78
00:05:58,645 --> 00:05:59,655
That is to say, you get this -

79
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,450
Ok ?

80
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,861
Ok, I got it.

81
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,713
What I do with my instrument, in fact, is that I combine the 2 instruments

82
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,572
into 1 only harmonica.

83
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,282
This means that roughly 45% of the notes I play do not exist

84
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,764
naturally on the instrument,

85
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:22,492
but I created them artificially in order to have a chromatic range

86
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:25,257
which includes the C scale and the C sharp one.

87
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:33,171
Ok, it's much more clear now.

88
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,033
Now, I understand why people consider you a true harmonica virtuoso.

89
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:42,242
And you started your career at only 19 with, what you previously mentioned,

90
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,106
appearances on the Nulle Part Ailleurs TV show.

91
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,542
Congratulations for having started a career at 19, tell me what's your secret ?!

92
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:50,534
Lots of work !

93
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,615
I guess.

94
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:55,251
Lots of work and perseverance.

95
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,262
I went out a lot in jazz clubs and did jam sessions.

96
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:05,180
I also worked a lot with musicians who had the patience to explain

97
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:07,330
what they expected from me

98
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:11,337
and pushed me into a corner of an instrument which is theoretically limited.

99
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:15,875
I think what really helped me to move forward pretty quickly,

100
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,480
was to understand the limits of the instrument

101
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,639
didn't really exist in the instrument, but more in myself.

102
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:25,626
So when I started to broaden a little bit my vision of the instrument

103
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,058
and music and to learn things,

104
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,349
I managed to incorporate them into my way of playing.

105
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,709
And as soon as you launched your career,

106
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,982
you decided right away to go to the United States.

107
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:40,124
Nobody knew you or expected you, but anyway you decided to go there.

108
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,659
The fact that nobody knew me or expected me helped me.

109
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:47,559
Let's go back to your beginnings in the USA.

110
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,053
You were only 19 ... well, maybe a little bit older.

111
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:54,720
Indeed, I was a little bit older, I was 24 when I left.

112
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,958
It was still a young age to do this.

113
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,027
Thank you.

114
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:02,022
In fact, I left around 24/25.

115
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:06,750
When I arrived there, I started a little to connect to the jazz scene

116
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,513
of Washington D.C, where there are a lot of musicians.

117
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,740
There is a huge jazz culture over there.

118
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:15,744
Duke Ellington was born in Washington D.C.

119
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:21,938
So, local musicians are proud to make it their duty to maintain

120
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:26,425
the jazz swing culture which Duke Ellington developed.

121
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:32,506
And alongside that, there is a more underground scene called the go-go,

122
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,282
which is actually a kind of funk with heavy African accents.

123
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:43,667
There's a lot of percussion in go-go music, which makes it very captivating.

124
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:50,626
Usually when you go to a go-go concert, it starts around midnight/1 o'clock AM

125
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:54,214
and musicians play till all hours.

126
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,316
They never stop because they play songs one after another

127
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:00,905
that are based on the same rhythm, which is kind of a jerky one.

128
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,396
I hope we can find music examples of this, I don't want to offend

129
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:08,174
go-go musicians by imitating them, because if I do,

130
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,186
I'm going to be stoned to death when I go back to ashington D.C.

131
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,969
No, no, don't worry, they don't watch us in Washington D.C.

132
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,816
We won't subtitle this part of the show.

133
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:16,176
Thanks.

134
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:18,435
I'd like to go back to your first 2 albums.

135
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:23,262
If I'm not wrong, first, there is Blowing Your Mind in Every Key of the Harp !

136
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,479
I had a hard time remembering it.

137
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,978
You're not wrong, I'm impressed !

138
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:29,938
And the second is called Front & Center.

139
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,073
Great !

140
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,893
I have a good memory, I did my homework a little bit before coming.

141
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,924
How was the recording process during these 2 albums ?

142
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:39,026
Do you have stories to share or collaborations that you did

143
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,928
and want to talk about ?

144
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:47,318
When I started working on Blowing Your Mind ..., it was meant to be a demo.

145
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:52,300
I tried to do a 5-track demo, in order to get gigs in Washington D.C

146
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,173
and to become known.

147
00:09:55,401 --> 00:10:01,270
At the end of my first few gigs, people came to ask me to buy the demo,

148
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:07,204
so we decided to pack it, make a record sleeve and put a cover photo.

149
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,370
A few thousand units were sold, which wasn't bad for a demo.

150
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,525
It was my 5-track first album.

151
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,957
Then, I decided to develop all that on a full-length album, so Front & Center.

152
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:23,808
It was at the time when it was still considered innovative

153
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:30,515
to create music on a computer.

154
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:34,073
I'm even tempted to call it computer music.

155
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,127
It was the transition from tape to hard disk.

156
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:40,477
I took the opportunity at that time to make half the group in France play,

157
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:45,101
and then to go back in the US with the tapes and to make them be played

158
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:46,928
with American musicians.

159
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:48,768
So, it was a real international project.

160
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,591
I have a Madagascan guitarist who lives in Paris.

161
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:53,076
I have a French percussionist called Patrick Ferbac,

162
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:56,055
who is now the artistic director of artist Grand Corps Malade,

163
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,250
and whom I met on Nulle Part Ailleurs.

164
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,252
And then all the rest of the musicians are in Washington D.C.

165
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,106
I managed to combine all that and yet these people have never met.

166
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,322
This is one of the stories I can share.

167
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:10,087
And it seems you're at the forefront of technology with your last output

168
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,439
Reed My Lips.

169
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:14,844
I'll remind people of the concept for those who haven't watched

170
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:17,170
the 1st Schkopi Show, which is very bad.

171
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:20,370
It's a reality CD concept.

172
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:23,627
For now, you can buy this card which gives you access to

173
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,654
the demo version of the album

174
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,466
and you can provide feedback that will be taken into account for its final version.

175
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,621
How did you get that idea ?

176
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,039
Is it because the music industry is in a bad state ?

177
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,442
Because the traditional way of making music

178
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,780
no longer matches market expectations ?

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,914
There were 2 things.

180
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,609
On the one hand, the truth is that people began to revive me

181
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:48,715
on the evolution of my 3rd project.

182
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:56,951
And my musical career over the last 4 years really pushed me to meet people

183
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:00,408
who could have an enormous influence on my project.

184
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:06,079
So I started to be more careful about the way I was moving on

185
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,379
by inviting people to participate in the album.

186
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,807
And their schedule began to affect mine.

187
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:21,373
Finally, I decided to anticipate on the usual album idea and distribute its rough cut,

188
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:27,194
and at the same time I took the opportunity to plant a seed of creativity

189
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:32,527
in the minds of people who can listen to the album.

190
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:38,190
The other thing that happened was that I had this idea exactly a year

191
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,085
after I started working with Prince.

192
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:46,473
And working with him opened my eyes on the music industry.

193
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:50,478
We all know that record companies are wasting away.

194
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:54,079
But working with him opened my eyes to the fact

195
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:57,971
it actually turns into a world of opportunities for independent artists

196
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:02,060
rather than being a big calamity that is falling down upon us.

197
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:12,316
So I started to change a little bit my perception of the music industry.

198
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:19,537
And I thought why not enjoy it and invite people to participate in a reality CD ?

199
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:22,393
Have you already received some feedback?

200
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:24,714
Have you already begun to work again

201
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,316
on the album following all the advice given ?

202
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,970
Yes, and I'm sorry if I haven't yet put the new songs on the server,

203
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,098
but I'll do it when I get back to Washington D.C.

204
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:40,980
I have already completed a new version of the album.

205
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:46,983
I got very positive feedback.

206
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,438
People are very excited about it because they actually feel like

207
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,180
they're part of the project,

208
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,058
and so it belongs to them a little bit too, which is a very good thing.

209
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,324
Maybe this project will help you to promote an harmonica-oriented album,

210
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:00,605
because I guess this isn't an easy task.

211
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,464
Of course, one can think of Stevie Wonder who had used a pseudonym

212
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:06,795
when he launched his harmonica-oriented album.

213
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:13,530
So how do you manage to promote such an unusual project ?

214
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:16,665
It's a good way to describe it.

215
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:26,873
Let's say that in what I do, I consider that my mission is accomplished

216
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:32,597
when I succeed in broadening people's perception of the harmonica,

217
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,949
that is to say when I get to break a little bit the stereotypes attached to it

218
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,165
such as its use only in blues, country or rock music.

219
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:55,105
And so this concept is a little bit in the same vein, it goes in the same direction.

220
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:58,998
In the versions currently available on the website, you mainly play the harmonica,

221
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,514
but do you play any other instruments or do you rely on other people ?

222
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:07,361
No, I wouldn't like to offend the people who listen to my album,

223
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:11,214
because most people who are into this kind of music would hear the difference

224
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:14,081
since they are musicians themselves, or at least music lovers.

225
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,991
They would soon realize this isn't a real drummer or a real bass player

226
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:19,224
on the recording.

227
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:20,908
Don't underestimate yourself !

228
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:25,461
No, I prefer to work on what I do best and leave what's left to do to my musicians

229
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,245
who are absolutely extraordinary, for whom I have great respect

230
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:31,777
and who inspire me.

231
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,641
That's actually the purpose of a project like this one,

232
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,078
because if I did everything all alone,

233
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:39,024
it would soon begin to be a very self-absorbed project.

234
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,921
And what I really want to do is to include as many people as possible

235
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,897
in this project

236
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,433
whether they are artists or fans.

237
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:49,792
All the musicians are from Washington D.C and Paris.

238
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:53,017
I used the same approach as before with the great help of the Internet.

239
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:53,754
It made it easier to achieve.

240
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:54,890
Exactly.

241
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:58,310
So, Patrick Ferbac once again did percussion on it

242
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,690
and I have other French friends who will participate in it.

243
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,166
No, it's important that everything doesn't come from me,

244
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,715
I think it would be a shame if it did.

245
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,785
In fact, it was a collective project.

246
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:06,925
Exactly.

247
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,644
As I mentioned earlier you're a world renowned artist,

248
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,580
and you just came back from Beirut.

249
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,045
What were you doing there ?

250
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:16,222
I was in Beirut to play with a new trio which has just been set up,

251
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:21,560
and that includes Patrick Ferbac and the Buddha Bar DJ  DJ Ravin.

252
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:26,317
We are a trio, the DJ as turntablist, Patrick plays percussion

253
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,690
and I play the harmonica.

254
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,306
We do electro-lounge music, now more jazz-oriented,

255
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:36,348
since live instruments are played.

256
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,954
We will start to tour a bit more with this trio,

257
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:43,292
it's a very interesting project and I'm very happy to be part of it.

258
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,893
I would like to talk about your collaborations.

259
00:16:46,162 --> 00:16:48,614
You already mentioned Grand Corps Malade,

260
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:51,530
and we also know you worked with Eryka Badu and John Legend.

261
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,857
How did these meetings go ?

262
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,288
What projects did you do together ?

263
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:03,078
With Eryka, it's a family affair if I may say.

264
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:06,840
We know very well each other and we get along really well

265
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,469
and we spend a lot of time privately.

266
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:13,493
We spend more time together in our private lives than in our professional lives.

267
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,336
I did concerts and tours with her.

268
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:10,722
We spent a lot of time doing music, but there aren't any recordings yet,

269
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,937
so that's what I'm trying to do with her now.

270
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:15,057
Ok, so it's planned.

271
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,224
Absolutely.

272
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,159
With John Legend, well, it was extraordinary.

273
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,751
He organized a fundraiser in Philadelphia,

274
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,787
and he invited me to participate in his concert.

275
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,620
I believe it was captured on film, there is a video somewhere online,

276
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,552
I'll try to find it.

277
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:32,359
We'll get it. Who else did you mention ?

278
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:34,282
Grand Corps Malade.

279
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,204
It was a very very emotional moment with him,

280
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:44,871
because my parents hit the road and went to Normandy to attend the 2 concerts.

281
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:48,237
And I think they were the last concerts

282
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:53,086
I did that my mother had the opportunity to attend before she passed away.

283
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,025
I understand.

284
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,659
On your Facebook profile, I saw you posed for pictures with other stars

285
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,693
including Chuck Brown and Quincy Jones.

286
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:06,143
Do you have projects with them?

287
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,438
What happened ? What these meetings were about ?

288
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:15,103
Chuck Brown and I are both part of the Washington D.C music community,

289
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:18,161
so we pass each other a lot, and also we share the same musicians.

290
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:22,477
A trombonist like Greg Boyer, who was on tour with Prince,

291
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:28,205
tours continuously with Chuck Brown.

292
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:35,067
The same goes for Quincy Jones, he's an extraordinary character.

293
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,919
There are a tremendous passion and generosity through what he does,

294
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:45,113
but he is very very busy in the music industry, so it's hard to get him.

295
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:48,003
And every time we spend time together,

296
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,734
we try to solve the world's problems, have drinks and speak French,

297
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,234
but there's still no music project planned, that said we're working on it.

298
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:02,158
Now I'd like to talk about the ultra mega superstars with whom you worked with,

299
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,068
such as Stevie Wonder, of course.

300
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:07,727
So I guess that as an harmonicist it was something huge to work

301
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,059
with Stevie Wonder.

302
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,133
You must tell us juicy stories about this collaboration.

303
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:14,754
Juicy stories about this collaboration ...

304
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,254
Or not that juicy.

305
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:22,250
I'll tell you the juiciest part after the video cameras are turned off.

306
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:30,498
I think that's a pretty good story to share to tell you how I met Stevie.

307
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:34,223
I met him in Los Angeles at the 2006 Grammy Awards.

308
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:38,266
A friend of mine, Dave Chappelle, was set to introduce

309
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:45,408
Sly & the Family Stone at the Grammy Awards, they were making a comeback.

310
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:50,541
It was quite an interesting performance,

311
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,835
I hope you'll get a chance to find it on YouTube because lots of things happened.

312
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,456
We'll watch it.

313
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:58,810
Go and see it on the net because it's quite interesting what happened.

314
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:04,250
That said, I was backstage with Dave,

315
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,186
and we were walking around a little in the corridor.

316
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:09,322
It was like I was walking around in a record store

317
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:11,772
and all the records were walking alive before me,

318
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,712
like Sting or Madonna.

319
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,507
Indeed, that must be something huge !

320
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,283
Yes, it was really magical.

321
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:22,102
And then, a moment later, we walked past a closed door

322
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,756
and I saw Stevie Wonder's name written on it.

323
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:29,135
Obviously, I started to lose my cool and I asked Dave

324
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,131
if he could introduce me to Stevie,

325
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:33,383
which he did with no problem at all.

326
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:38,041
He introduced me to Stevie and explained to him I was a French harmonicist.

327
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:42,155
As usual, Stevie was really kind and generous.

328
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:45,477
He shook my hand and told me, "Wow ! Nice to meet you etc ..."

329
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:49,802
And then, something interesting happened.

330
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,953
The attention on Stevie began to fade

331
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,526
and the people who introduced us began to talk among themselves.

332
00:21:56,931 --> 00:22:01,191
So I found myself in Los Angeles at the Grammys alone with Stevie.

333
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:05,668
And since everyone left us literally alone I took the opportunity to ask him

334
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:08,893
what harmonica brand he was using.

335
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,268
He said he was using Hohner.

336
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:15,353
And I asked if he ever heard of the Zidle brand.

337
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:19,549
He said no and asked me if it was a good one.

338
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:23,294
And I told him to just let me show him to judge its quality.

339
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:25,996
So I pulled out of my pocket my harmonica and played him one of his songs.

340
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,248
During the whole thing, he had his hand on my arm like this.

341
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:31,821
He was listening to me and after a while he began to do this.

342
00:22:32,206 --> 00:22:34,769
I finished the song and asked him if it reminded him of something.

343
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,267
He said, Of course ! and asked me if it was a chromatic harmonica.

344
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,687
In my opinion, this was the greatest compliment he could give me

345
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:50,562
because Stevie has been playing the chromatic harmonica since his youth.

346
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:54,442
So he couldn't tell the difference between the blues harmonica

347
00:22:54,662 --> 00:22:56,884
and the instrument he plays,

348
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:59,699
because I succeeded in playing scales he has access with his instrument

349
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,994
on an instrument which doesn't have them naturally.

350
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,721
So later in our relationship, I had the opportunity to explain to him

351
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,520
the technique I apply on the diatonic instrument,

352
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:11,509
and he has well progressed since.

353
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:13,876
You give lessons to Stevie Wonder.

354
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:17,742
I just want to point it out to the people who are watching us.

355
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:21,539
This is the man who gives lessons to Stevie Wonder, he's not just anyone.

356
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,969
I don't know if one can put it this way.

357
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,104
Let's just say I showed him a trick.

358
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,402
Is there a collaboration planned ?

359
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:30,813
We plan to work together.

360
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:33,886
Can you tell us a bit more about it ?

361
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:44,279
I don't want to sound superstitious but I'd rather keep it to myself,

362
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:47,711
so when it comes out it will have more impact,

363
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:50,606
because I believe from all the projects I have,

364
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:53,532
this one has the best chance to happen this year.

365
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:55,298
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you then.

366
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,003
Knock on wood.

367
00:23:57,406 --> 00:24:00,029
Now let's talk about one of your other famous

368
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:02,617
collaborations which is obviously Prince,

369
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:04,512
since this is after all the Schkopi Show 

370
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,150
the Web TV of Prince and the Minneapolis Sound fans.

371
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,070
I'm listening.

372
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:13,831
You can't even imagine how many questions I received on the forum

373
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:16,328
when it was announced you would participate in the show.

374
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,528
Really ?

375
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:19,504
We'll go back to this a bit later on.

376
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,435
But first, tell me how did you meet Prince ?

377
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:26,255
The first time I met him was at his home.

378
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:37,075
It was at 3121, the house he rented in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles.

379
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:46,294
It was a huge house with his symbol inlaid in the middle of the living room parquet.

380
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:49,992
When I got there there were very few people.

381
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,301
It was a Grammy party which was attended by Quincy Jones,

382
00:24:53,628 --> 00:25:00,144
Erykah Badu, Common, Jamie Foxx,

383
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:05,147
Mariah Carey ...  many people were there, that said it was very intimate.

384
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,204
I was introduced to Prince, I shook his hand.

385
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:12,455
The Time was playing that night and one asked if I could jam with the band.

386
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:18,732
And his answer was, "We will listen to him, but another time".

387
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:26,224
Obviously, I wasn't expecting any other answer,

388
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,275
but it was still a little surprising to hear it.

389
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:34,794
That said, we spent a wonderful evening, but then we lost touch.

390
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,759
And one evening in November 2007, Stevie was playing

391
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:41,554
at Madison Square Garden, New York City,

392
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:46,770
and he asked me to do our little duet together.

393
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,494
So I went on stage after Tony Bennett.

394
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:55,316
Stevie did a duet with Tony Bennett on "For Once in My Life".

395
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:58,877
It was just with a piano, Tony and Stevie, and it was great.

396
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,754
Tony gave us the impression that the Madison Square Garden was a jazz club.

397
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,762
He has a voice which is so ... let's move on.

398
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:13,265
Once the audience was well warmed up by Tony and Stevie,

399
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:16,888
I heard the little bass line of "Boogie On Reggae Woman"

400
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:19,117
which began to rise on the keyboard,

401
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:22,383
and I thought then, here we go, it's my turn to play.

402
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:25,213
I went on stage and we did an absolutely extraordinary jam.

403
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:27,353
I believe from all the performances we did together that

404
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,658
was probably one of the best.

405
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:33,119
We ended up holding hands on stage

406
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,414
because Stevie had a little bit lost his balance

407
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,450
since he was playing and with hyperventilation it wasn't easy for him.

408
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,450
I kept him from falling in front of the stage and at the same time we were playing.

409
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,695
We found ourselves face to face and it was amazing.

410
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,736
The energy was really extraordinary at this moment,

411
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,402
it was great, everyone stood up.

412
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:52,570
I was very proud of me, I left the stage and went to get something to drink.

413
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:56,174
And then I came across Larry Graham, who wore his big coat and hat.

414
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:58,685
And I said to myself, My god, an apparition !

415
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,024
I asked him what he was doing here.

416
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:01,603
He said he came to have fun.

417
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:02,911
I asked him if he intended to play.

418
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,808
He said it wasn't at all his intention, he just came to listen to the concert.

419
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:07,883
And behind me I was hearing the audience was still screaming.

420
00:27:07,883 --> 00:27:11,267
I thought to myself they were crazy.

421
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:13,962
I opened the curtain, everyone was screaming and looking at the stage,

422
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,842
everyone was having fun and had stood up.

423
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,829
I was wondering what was going on.

424
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,880
I looked onstage and saw my friend guitarist Errol Cooney on the side like this,

425
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,222
looking at something.

426
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:23,921
I thought, How come he's not playing guitar ?!

427
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:26,721
And I looked a little further and saw Prince on stage

428
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:31,011
playing "Superstition" with Stevie, and thought Ok, I get it now !

429
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:36,155
I was hoping to reconnect with him after the concert,

430
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:40,112
but he disappeared as fast as he appeared, as usual.

431
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:46,324
And it took another 6 months to wait before there was another party

432
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:51,999
which was held in his new home in Los Angeles and I was invited to attend.

433
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:55,842
That night we passed each other again.

434
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,700
When we were shaking hands I tried to remind him

435
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,561
of the Madison Square Garden concert, but he didn't recall it at all.

436
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:04,872
Around 10 minutes later, I was in a hallway talking to the

437
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:08,743
South Carolina singer Anthony Hamilton.

438
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,391
I explained to him how the harmonica works, as I showed you earlier.

439
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,800
And I heard someone saying,

440
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:19,857
"Oh, but you didn't play for Stevie but with Stevie.

441
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:22,699
I turned around and saw that Prince was watching the scene,

442
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:26,134
and for which it started to click.

443
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:30,013
Since that day, he started calling me and asked me to play in the studio

444
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,939
or at various events such as fundraisers, Grammy or Oscar after parties,

445
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:37,742
or even the European tour.

446
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:02,029
So I'll ask you questions from the forum members.

447
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:03,145
Let's go !

448
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,280
Did you ever suggest tracks or music directions to Prince,

449
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:10,211
if so, were your proposals selected ?

450
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:13,424
I did it once, and I won't do it again.

451
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:18,027
Oh ! Why ? What happened ?

452
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:25,895
He was clear on that, he's leading and I'm just following him.

453
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,350
Ok, so we stop talking about it.

454
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:34,654
Do you have the impression of belonging to the NPG band

455
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:37,260
or do you feel more like a recurring guest artist ?

456
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:43,673
I don't think I'm a member of the band.
I'm clearly a special and occasional guest.

457
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:48,209
The fact that I participated in most of his concerts over the past 2 years

458
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:52,934
doesn't make me an official member of the band.

459
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:57,255
On the contrary, I think he showed respect towards me.

460
00:29:57,488 --> 00:30:00,394
In fact, when he invites me it's in order to spice up his music from time to time,

461
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,984
but it doesn't make me a member of the band.

462
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,506
Everyone knows it's a band which varies according to circumstances.

463
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,976
So maybe it isn't easy to get used to all the changes.

464
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,887
It is said there are 3 different line-ups for the NPG group.

465
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:15,285
Have you been asked to work with each of them or not at all ?

466
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:18,694
Yes, all of them except the last one,

467
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:21,931
because I haven't met the new bass player yet.

468
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:26,780
I don't know if you remember this, but when the Lotusflow3r album came out,

469
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:34,212
he wanted to use 3 groups for its promotion on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

470
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,749
NPG was the first one, the second one featured drummer Michael Bland

471
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:38,815
and bass player Sonny T. ...

472
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:43,846
He played with NPG on Wednesday and Friday,

473
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,614
and with Michael Bland and Sonny T. on Thursday night.

474
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:53,175
In theory, he should have played on Friday night with John Blackwell,

475
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:58,030
Rhonda Smith and Renato Nato, but for princely matters he changed his mind

476
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,414
at the last minute.

477
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,449
So, yes, I played with the 3 line-ups.

478
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:06,002
Do you have any preference between the 3 of them ?

479
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:10,587
They are all in a different vein.

480
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,268
The energy is truly different between the 3 groups.

481
00:31:13,587 --> 00:31:17,361
I love Michael Bland's punch and Sonny T.'s virtuosity.

482
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:20,301
I like a lot the correlation between Josh and Cora.

483
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,612
It's absolutely extraordinary.

484
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,926
It's very hard to find a bass player and a drummer who live together

485
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,307
and who know each other very well musically,

486
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:31,766
it's amazing the correlation between the 2.

487
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:36,910
Between John Blackwell and Rhonda Smith, it's such a different spirit,

488
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:42,235
it works amazingly, but that's a total different world.

489
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,088
As for any preference, I'd say it depends on my mood.

490
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,456
Another question.

491
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:55,807
Do you think that being French was a plus in your collaboration with him,

492
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:57,896
knowing that he particularly likes France ?

493
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:00,039
He likes our culture.

494
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,990
He likes French fashion, food and architecture,

495
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:09,134
but when it comes to French music ...

496
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:13,760
When we went together to see a band play, he was rather surprised.

497
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,732
He was surprised by the fact that the band played a rather elaborated music,

498
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:23,215
and the audience was talking as if the music was only background sound.

499
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:27,875
He was a little disappointed by the fact that people paid no attention

500
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:31,085
to what was happening on stage, at least at this place.

501
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:38,615
I know he auditioned French musicians, but it hasn't been fruitful yet,

502
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:43,030
but you never can tell.

503
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,617
So, I don't know if my nationality really had an influence on our collaboration.

504
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,977
Ok, it was just a question from the forum members.

505
00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:51,194
Sure.

506
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:55,614
I have my own idea on this, but why didn't you participate in the fall tour ?

507
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:59,170
What do you think of it ?

508
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:02,405
Maybe you and him had an argument ?

509
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:04,714
No, no, there was no tension.

510
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:07,312
I think he simply wanted something else.

511
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:12,928
Or maybe you had information that I didn't have.

512
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:15,866
That's it, in fact I have Prince's direct phone line, and he told me about it ...

513
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:19,109
That's it ! 777 - ...

514
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,994
I have to tell you something, I just love your shirt.

515
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:25,035
Thank you.

516
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:28,052
Its designer comes from Amsterdam, Netherlands.

517
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:31,467
I've been working with him for a while.

518
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,903
It's not because I'm a harmonicist that

519
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:34,195
I don't have the right to love fashion, right ?

520
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:36,006
You're so right !

521
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:38,533
So what else do we have in the list of questions?

522
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,704
In your opinion, can the harmonica replace the brass in Prince's music ?

523
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:47,441
It's a double-edged question.

524
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:52,950
The brass have a very specific color that convey a very different emotion

525
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:55,811
from what the harmonica can generate.

526
00:33:56,168 --> 00:34:00,919
So, in my opinion, I think it's possible to replace them.

527
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,033
I don't think it has been done in Prince's music yet,

528
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:07,574
because it wasn't used for this purpose.

529
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:11,289
The harmonica was used in a very different way.

530
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:16,660
When he called me, it was because he really wanted to work on something

531
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,301
other than the brass.

532
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:21,308
What he had in mind wasn't really to replace them by the harmonica,

533
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:23,144
but to use it as an other color and function.

534
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:27,034
You may have read a lot of criticism regarding your participation

535
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,652
to Prince's summer tour.

536
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,516
Maybe some of them weren't very positive.

537
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,866
How did you feel about them ?

538
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:36,140
Today is the day to take the opportunity to get revenge !

539
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,964
Not at all.

540
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:42,810
On the one hand, I know most people come to Prince concerts to see Prince.

541
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:49,253
On the other hand, I can conceive the fact they like or not the harmonica,

542
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:54,246
but I think, in fact, it's my fault if I failed to convince and convert them

543
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:58,223
to the beauty of the instrument.

544
00:34:58,223 --> 00:34:59,965
No, it's not your fault !

545
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:03,641
Now, I'm working on making up for it on my current project.

546
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,460
Give criticism if you really have something to say.

547
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,513
So, if they don't like the sound of the harmonica in Prince's music,

548
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,572
which I think was done maybe once or twice ...

549
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:20,856
I think I saw at the end of a DVD he brought in a harmonicist to jam,

550
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:23,705
but I don't think it was done on tour before.

551
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:28,452
Anyway, with him, everything is experimental.

552
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,231
Some things work, some others don't.

553
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:36,595
In my opinion, there were songs in which the harmonica was a nice addition.

554
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,605
Now there's one thing you need to know,

555
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,834
and I'm not saying this to defend myself,

556
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:49,579
but he never called me to rehearsals, so when I was invited to perform on stage,

557
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:54,484
I was discovering most of the songs while I was actually playing them.

558
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,165
A last word on this collaboration,

559
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,424
do you have any reproaches, things you loved, things which surprised you,

560
00:36:33,897 --> 00:36:35,735
or made you angry?

561
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:40,839
No, I learned a lot of things during the time we collaborated together.

562
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:46,823
I learned to really focus on my project.

563
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:49,956
Now, I know what works for the harmonica and what doesn't,

564
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:55,916
thanks to the feedback I received for example on Prince fan forums.

565
00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:59,516
I also know what works for the harmonica.

566
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:05,713
Now, I have a more clear direction on what I want to focus on.

567
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,661
This collaboration with him was extraordinary, I learned a lot musically.

568
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:18,883
I carefully observed him over the last 2 years, I took notes,

569
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:23,040
and now it's me do my thing.

570
00:37:23,462 --> 00:37:27,786
So I consider I graduated from Prince high school, now it's time to go to college.

571
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,407
Thank you very much for participating and answering all our questions.

572
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:38,215
A final word for your French and international fans since this show is subtitled.

573
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:45,103
Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to sit next to you, Pauline.

574
00:37:45,322 --> 00:37:48,396
It was a real pleasure, thank you for your questions, thank you for your interest

575
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,289
and I hope we'll meet again very soon at concerts.

576
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:51,398
See you soon !

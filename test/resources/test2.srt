1
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,394
Well, nobody can work correctly.

2
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,360
Are you OK?

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,120
So, this is the basis...

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,480
the basis of our intentions.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,620
To explain to you in this debate, the meaning

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,880
of their commitment within the Front De Gauche...

7
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,234
Oh there's the star!

8
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,720
I think we can't speak here !

9
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,559
So, the canditates to the Socialists presidential primaries

10
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:23,567
for reasons we understand,

11
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:25,521
say : "we have to go to the FÌ»te de l'Huma,

12
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:28,564
and approach the Front De Gauche."

13
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,526
So to us it means - and that's a good news -

14
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,301
that the time for contempt is over,

15
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,080
and that they'll start to say

16
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,580
what they think about what's in there.

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,740
That is what matters, not me.

18
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,159
Are you OK?

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,940
Thank you for your invitation.

20
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,467
The one who will lead will be supported by the others.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,480
I think, that if I'm leading the Left,

22
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:52,252
as the Socialist party's prime secretary just told you,

23
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,092
they will vote for me. Done !

24
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:56,103
Harlem Desir : And Vice Versa!
